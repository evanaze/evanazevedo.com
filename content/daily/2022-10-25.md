Yesterday I got a new simple laptop for just coding and working on personal projects. Today, I set up my workstation with VS Code, ZSH, pyenv, Brave Browser, Obsidian, etc. Now I should be pretty close to being ready to start developing.

I'm participating in the [AWS Data Exchange for APIs Challenge](https://awsdataexchange4apis.devpost.com/). I now have an idea for what I want to build: using economic and satellite data to make a dashboard for remote workers to decide where to live.
