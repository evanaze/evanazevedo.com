Armed with more sleep, today I took better notes about Poly-Commitment schemes like KZG. Yesterday I skimmed through the videos and I thought that would be enough, but today I realized that I really didn't grasp much of it.

Additionally, I learned some of the basics of Rust, like references (`&`), which use pointers and ownership (`::`):

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len))
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

These two concepts were the biggest, immediately noticeable difference from languages that I've used before like Python and Dark.
