Today I used a combination of [dask-geopandas](https://dask-geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) in order to simply parallelize the tiling program. Right now it's only running on two workers, so I'll have to scale that up to get it to run faster, but it seems to be working a lot easier than using `multiprocessing`.
