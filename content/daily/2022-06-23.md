I didn't get around to doing much machine learning work today. However, I dove a bit deeper into enabling Google Analytics for my blog, and I added Disqus comments in preparation to share my blog with others.

I need to set up a newsletter template - even if it is rudimentary, and about me page. I hope to have this done by Sunday for my next blog post.
