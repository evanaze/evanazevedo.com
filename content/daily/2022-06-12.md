I discovered the amazing book [Build a Career in Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Career-Science-Jacqueline-Nolis/dp/1617296244). Never before have I seen the path to a data science career so clearly defined without loosing too much of the complexity. I skimmed through it today, and have already noticed mistakes I've made in the past when I tried to get into data science.

I've decided that I'm going to go the self-taught route - as opposed to a boot camp or masters program - and will try to get opportunities to do data science work in my job.

I also have a couple ideas for portfolio projects, one of which I seems very doable and I would've started immediately; however, I couldn't sign in to Twitter today from my laptop. Here are the ideas:

- My friend from college [@PlaceboAddict](https://twitter.com/PIaceboAddict) has some funky, cerebral tweets that I think would be really cool to try and generate using ML.

- A tool that takes a video conversation, such as a podcast recording on Youtube, and tries to score who in the conversation is higher status. Inspired by the book [The Elephant in the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Brain-Hidden-Motives-Everyday/dp/0190495995) and its chapter on status.
- A mental garden for my notes on machine learning, statistics, self-improvement, etc. This is I think the lowest priority on the list because it does show the skill of communication and tech savvy-ness, but is not quite related to data science.
