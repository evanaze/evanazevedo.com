Today I spent all of my time coding for Joby, and didn't do any hacking in the morning. I'm really excited by the project, and stitched together code from [this](https://ahmed-nafies.medium.com/fastapi-with-sqlalchemy-postgresql-and-alembic-and-of-course-docker-f2b7411ee396) tutorial on setting up FastAPI on a Postgres database, and [this](https://dev.to/jbrocher/fastapi-testing-a-database-5ao5) tutorial on how to unit test it.

In order to make those work together, I had to use [pytest-mock-resources](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock-resources/) to spin up a test Postgres database, rather than roll back the changes I made during testing.
