Today I worked on processing the raw tweets into tweets suitable for modeling. I did this by imposing the following constraints:

- Removing tweets shorter than 3 words.
- Removing trailing whitespaces.
- Removing urls.

In the future I'll want to double check that all multimedia is removed, including images and videos.

I plan on moving away from a SQL backend to get used to NoSQL and serverless framework, with the plan of publishing on Rapid API. This will allow users to experiment with the API without it coming out of my pocket. If a user wants to scale up their usage, then they'll have to pay the extra fee.
