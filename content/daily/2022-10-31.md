Thanks to a helpful maintainer on the Meltano repository, I got some quick help on getting Meltano back up and running.
I configured my data source, database, and dashboard app using Meltano, but I haven't run anything yet. Tomorrow I will
use Meltano to load the data from my sources into the database and learn how to do some basic [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/getting-started-dbt-core)
to transform my data.
