Yesterday I attended the ZKHacks III kickoff. I didn't have time to attempt the [puzzle](https://github.com/ZK-Hack/puzzle-zero-sum-game) yesterday, so I started it today.

The puzzle is definitely difficult (for me). I think I may have an idea of how it works though. The protocol sends a polynomial that sums to zero over some set $S$ with the note, and then expects the polynomial to no longer sum to zero over $S$. My thought is that if the prover can change the polynomial that it sends back to still sum to 0 over $S$, then maybe it can fool the verifier and double-spend.
