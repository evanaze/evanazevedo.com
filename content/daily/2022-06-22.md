Today I finally was able to download all of the tweets that the Twitter API allows for a single user w/o retweets - 800 tweets. Right now, I'm storing the data in a SQLite3 database.

In the future I'd like to make this with a serverless architecture so users who input their API key are helping to build the dataset.

I also found a very similar project to mine called [huggingtweets](https://github.com/borisdayma/huggingtweets). It seems pretty successful, so that's a good sign.

Of course I still think the project is still worth doing for sharpening my skill set. It is not surprising that my first project idea is not unique. The upside is he did such a good job with it, I can take what he has done - explore the project with Google Collab, super thorough documentation on Github and sharing it on 3rd party websites - and expand it.

Next up I need to make code to clean and process the data.
