Today I just [wrote up](../../hackathon/fail/) my experience with the AWS Data Exchange hackathon. I also made some changes to my website, including:

- Removing a pesky `Input: minutes` line that was popping up in my articles, and
- Looking into adding links to my social accounts in my [About](../../about) page.

On that note, I think I'm going to be migrating this website to PaperMod. It seems to have great features and a really clean design.
