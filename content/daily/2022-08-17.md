I'm starting WordLabs, my project which is a text-based version of Tick Tock. I love the idea of algorithmic-centered app design, and reducing the barrier to entry for people to experiment with writing.

Similarly to how Tick Tock allows people who don't have a following to get viral with their videos, I want to remove the need to create a "social graph" before you can prototype your writing on Twitter.
