I created a [Git repo](https://github.com/evanaze/placebot) for my Tweet generator project. It looks like I can actually do something kind of interesting. Similar projects I found online use statistical methods such as Markov Chains. I think a project that utilizes a LLM like GPT-2 or GPT-3 can be a lot more interesting.

## How it will work

The first iteration will just download the LLM artifact and tune it on the user's computer. I'll use SQLite for storing and accessing the Tweets and use a normalized database format.

Later I can enable the user to train the model and generate tweets using the cloud. This would be a great opportunity to practice developing with a serverless architecture. I could also make the user pay to use the API, or I can make it free. If I were to make it paid, I would use a crypto product to make the micro-transactions easier.

Other ideas I had are as follows:

- Ability to make a “child” - tune the model based on multiple twitter accounts.
- Weight tweets by number of likes/reposts.
