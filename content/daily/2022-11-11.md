Today I moved the code that I was prototyping last night to tile the census tracts from a Jupyter notebook to a Python script. I also added `multiprocessing` to speed up the program, and I am currently running it on my work laptop which is the strongest machine I have. It has an 11th gen i7 with 12 cores and 32 GB of memory, and the program has been running for 1 and 3/4 hours.

I'm amazed at how long this is taking, but considering the amount of compute that I need to accomplish I'm not surprised. Once this is complete then I can do a similar process with the zip or neighborhood data so I can join the Zillow data.

Tomorrow I'd also like to add a chart for my time spent to my [scoreboard](../../scoreboard/) using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/).
