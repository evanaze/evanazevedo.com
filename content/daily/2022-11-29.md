Since today is the final day to submit a solution to the puzzle and I don't think I'm going to be able to solve it, I decided to instead read solutions to previous puzzles to get a feel for what was going on.

In the process, I started to get a sense that this field may not be for me. I think I could get the skill to be able to solve these puzzles, especially given my Physics background and experience with programming, but I don't think this would be the best use of my time.

I'm going to spend some time over the next day or two to reflect and consider my priorities.
