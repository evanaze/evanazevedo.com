I'm still trying to collect the data for the app. I fiddled around this morning with the `asyncio` standard library in Python to write to the database, but I decided that was unnecessary.

I also refined my very simple data model and learned about data normalization.

In case you don't know, database normalization is a very sexy topic about how data is stored in relational databases. It's far too racy to go into here, but suffice to say that I had a fun morning learning what a 1NF or first normal form schema is, up to 5NF or fifth normal form.

In my case, I only need two tables: `tweets` for the tweets I download and `users` to keep track of the usernames.

Hopefully, by tomorrow, I will have loaded my friend [Josh](https://twitter.com/PIaceboAddict)'s tweets into the database and I can start to experiment with machine learning.
