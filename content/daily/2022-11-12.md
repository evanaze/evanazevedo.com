Today I spent some time using chezmoi to save my dotfiles after having to begrudgingly re-setup my computer after [bricking it](daily/2022-11-08). Outside of that, I didn't make a lot of visible progress on my hackathon project, but I found a couple of data sources that I think will be useful:

#### Income as a fraction of home price

Basically how far does your money go in an area for housing.

- Median income by census tract from [census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=income&g=0100000US%241400000&y=2020&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S1901)
- I was finally able to download the home price index from Zillow on the zip level, and I downloaded the zip codes map from [opendatasoft.com](https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/?disjunctive.language&disjunctive.source_domain_title&disjunctive.theme&disjunctive.semantic.classes&disjunctive.semantic.properties&sort=explore.popularity_score&q=zip+code). Next will be to do the same tiling that I'm doing on the census tracts on that data.

#### Economic activity

I need to use the APIs from the hackathon, so I'm going to pull [credit card spending](https://db.nomics.world/oppins/AFF) and [employment levels](https://db.nomics.world/oppins/EMP) from the Rearc API to show economic activity.

I also continued to run the tiling program on my work laptop. It's been working for almost 6 hours and is probably about half done.
