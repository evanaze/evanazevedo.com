Unfortunately, I ran into a bug when using Meltano and was unable to move forward with my project. I submitted a bug [ticket](https://github.com/meltano/meltano/issues/6947) on the Meltano Github. If I don't have a solution by tomorrow, then I will just go forward with trying to plot the data on Superset manually the old-fashioned way.

Today I started late, so I wasn't able to get much done. Note to self - start hacking early on the weekends so you can chill in the evenings.
