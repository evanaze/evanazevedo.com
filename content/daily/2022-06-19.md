Today I found the awesome textbook [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969) by the fantastic Chip Huyen. This is my inspiration for my career development and which projects to build.

For better or for worse, I also found the website [Blind](ttps://www.teamblind.com/) which I think is red-pilling me about getting a big-tech job. I'm still not sure if I need to spend all of my energy trying to get a job at a FAANG company.

In fact, I'm actually more convinced about the opposite. As of now, my priorities for my next career move are:

1. Building machine learning in production, AKA shipping models and/or helping make decisions that drive business impact.
2. Working remotely/flexible work arrangements.
3. Working on something that makes the world better, not worse.

I believe sufficient pay could make me forget about the last two, but it would have to be a significant premium.
