Today I found the awesome textbook [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969) by the fantastic Chip Huyen. This is my inspiration for my career development and which projects to build.

For better or for worse, I also found the website [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/) which I think is red-pilling me about getting a big-tech job. I'm still not sure if I need to spend all of my energy trying to get a job at a FAANG company.

However, I doubt it will last. In fact, I'm actually more convinced about the opposite. As of now, my priorities for my next career move from most to least important are:

1. Creating value for others
2. Working on something that makes the world better, not worse
3. Learning my desired skill-set. Right now this is shipping machine learning models and/or helping make decisions that drive business impact.
4. Independence. I want to do work as an independent consultant/freelancer and move towards being an entrepreneur.
5. Making a lot of money

It seems the future of work is going to shrink smaller and smaller around the individual, so learning how to build a network seems a good way to go for me.
