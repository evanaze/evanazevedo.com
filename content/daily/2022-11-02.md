Today I got to work on the transformation side of the data pipeline. I installed [dbt-osmosis](https://github.com/z3z1ma/dbt-osmosis), which gives a REPL experience for using dbt. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to start the REPL, but I was able to connect it with the dbt project that Meltano had created in my project directory.
