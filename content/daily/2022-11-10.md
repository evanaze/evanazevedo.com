I discovered that the errors I was getting on using Polyfill last time were from MultiPolygons, which apparently don't work for `h3.polyfill`. By adding some simple error handling with my filling function I was able to skip the two tracts that were MultiPolygons and complete the fill.

I also added `h3.compact` around the polyfill so that I reduce the number of hexagons, which would be in danger of overloading memory if I saved them all. I think it may still be a danger of doing so, but with how long a single fill takes it's likely that I'll have to run this on AWS anyways.
