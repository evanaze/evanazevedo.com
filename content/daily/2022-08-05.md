**Inputs**: 1 hour.

**Outputs**: Zero-shot classification and hand-calculated classification metrics.

Today I implemented zero-shot learning (ZSL) for the [Feedback Prize](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-effectiveness) Kaggle competition. The performance is really bad - about as good as random chance. However, I implemented the code for calculating the classification metrics by hand and got some good practice that way.

I also got to learn a bit about using Hugging Face, and now I have a high-level understanding about how to use their API.

[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/evanaze/feedback-prize-submission?scriptVersionId=102624066) is my notebook if you are interested.
