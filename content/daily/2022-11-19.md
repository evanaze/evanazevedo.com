Today I spent a lot of time troubleshooting speeding up my tiling program with Dask. The primary issue I had to overcome was that the tiling function takes in a relatively small parquet file with some [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) polygons (0.5 - 50 MB), and then consumes a HUGE amount of memory in the tiling process with `h3.polyfill`.
