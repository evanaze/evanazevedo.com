I spent about an hour this morning working on my tweet generator project. I am using the [tweepy](https://tweepy.readthedocs.org/) Python package to access the Twitter API. I'm able to get the user's ID from the Twitter handle and am working on downloading their tweets next.

The API limits you to downloading 3,600 tweets at a time. For now I'll just stick with that limit, and maybe in the future I can see if there is a way to work around that.

I'm also going to be incorporating SQLite3 as the database for the tweets. If I decide to make a more scalable version of this then it would be helpful to not have to re-download the same tweets if multiple people wanted to imitate Elon Musk, for example.
