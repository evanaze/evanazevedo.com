Unfortunately, I woke up early this morning and was unable to get back to bed. I also didn't finish my 90 minutes in the morning, so when I got back to it in the evening I just was unable to focus. Fortunately I was able to finish the medium difficulty questions. I think I will save the hard questions for now, and make a writeup of my solutions or some other knowledge artifact.
