**Inputs**: 1 hour

**Outputs**: Able to write to Google Firestore with Python, making a simple script to scrape a couple RSS feeds and upload them to Firestore.

#### Description

Today I figured out how to use Google Firebase's Python SDK to connect to Cloud Firestore and started to refactor my RSS feed parsing script to write the posts to Firestore.

[This](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart?hl=en&authuser=0) is the guide I used to connect to Firestore, and I'm using a 3-rd party Python library called [Feedparser](https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html) to grab articles from people's RSS feeds.
