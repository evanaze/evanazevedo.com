Today I took a little detour and played around with searching through available domain names using Derek Sivers' [methodology](https://sive.rs/com).

I basically downloaded a list of available `.com` domains from ICANN and started to parse through and programmatically find good ones. I'm amazed at how large the database is. The total file size of available `.com` domains is ~25GB. I had to load it onto a database using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) which I've been enjoying as kind of a SQLite3 alternative recently.
