Today I finished writing my notes on SNARKs. I'm also going to try and share them using the awesome [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) theme for Hugo. Now that I have some of the baseline knowledge that I need, I'm having trouble cracking the puzzle.

I have no idea how [Aurora](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/828.pdf) relates to the puzzle, and the [Marlin preprocessing](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/marlin/blob/026b73c20638f4f86cbae0946045934c865d5a30/diagram/diagram.pdf) step is very difficult for me to understand.

Tomorrow I'm going to try and implement a prover that simply passes the verifier, and then I'll try to cheat the verifier.
