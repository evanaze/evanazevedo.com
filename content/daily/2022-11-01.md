I used Meltano, specifically the `tap-spreadsheets-anywhere` extractor to load data into DuckDB using the `target-duckdb` loader. It worked great for my Opportunity Atlas data, but unfortunately was unable to find the Zillow data or the Census-tract-to-zipcode data that I was also hoping to load.

I was also hoping to get to the `dbt` work, but that will have to wait for another time. I stopped early because I had a dentist's appointment.

Here is the error I saw:

```python

```

The filename is `data/ZIP_TRACT_122021.xlsx`, and I am using the fuzzy match pattern `ZIP_TRACT_*.xlsx`. Fortunately, I found that I could just specify the filename exactly and I would have an issue. If I continue with this project and need to use it for constantly refreshing data then this might turn into a problem.
