I'm just working with the basics with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Today I tried to simply read an HTML file and then display it on the app, but I couldn't figure out how to read the file.

I think the next step for me will be to just input the raw text into the program to make sure that displaying it works, since ultimately I won't be reading the HTML from a file anyways.

Next step will be loading the HTML from a webserver, which I will set up locally using Docker. Then I will add like, dislike, and share buttons. Next after that will be tracking app usage data.
