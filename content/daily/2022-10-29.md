The awesome tool [Meltano](https://meltano.com/) made it very easy for me to connect the data files I've downloaded with my
DuckDB database and the Apache Superset dashboard that I'm going to create. It really simplifies the tak of creating an
analytics data stack.

I also played around with Apache Superset a little bit, and noodled on the idea of how to represent the Opportunity Atlas
data, which is separated by Census Tract with the other data which is separated by Zip code. The problem is that there can be
multiple zip codes per census tract, and multiple census tracts per zip code (many-to-many). The simplest solution would
be to average the census tracts up to the zip code.

So if census tract $A$ overlapped with zip codes $[z_1, z_2]$ and census tract $B$ overlaps with zip code $z_2$, then the data for
zip code $z_2$ would be $\textrm{Opportunity Atlas}(z_2) = \frac{A + B}/{2}$. A more sophisticated calculation would weight
each zip code based on the fraction belonging in each census tract.
