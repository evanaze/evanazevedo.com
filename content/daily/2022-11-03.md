Today I discovered that you can't alter primary key columns in a SQL table. I tried to fix this by loading the data into tables with a new unique identifier column, but I couldn't figure out how to do that with [tap-spreadsheets-anywhere](https://github.com/ets/tap-spreadsheets-anywhere).

Also, I discovered that `tap-spreadsheets-anywhere` uses the project's `meltano.db` to determine which files to load based on the actions taken by meltano. So in order to re-load the data I had to edit `meltano.db` to remove the recording of the previous data insert so I could insert the data again.

All that and 90 minutes later I was back where I started. Hopefully tomorrow goes a bit better...
