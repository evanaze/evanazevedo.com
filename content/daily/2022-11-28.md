The equation to solve for the puzzle is: $\hat{f} + \hat{s} = \xi \hat{g} + \mathbb{Z}_H \cdot \hat{h} + ...$

The "$...$" is to indicate the terms `statement.sum + card_inverse` which have to do with the polynomial sent with the statement, but I'm not sure what they mean outside of that. Also, $\xi$ in the code is a random number, and I'm not sure why that is part of the verification step either.
