Last night I left my tiling program running while I slept. Since I changed the program to save each state after it's finished tiling I expected at least a good chunck of the tiling to be done when I woke up. To my dismay, only a few states were saved.

Today I learned a lot about multiprocessing, and am on the process of troubleshooting why I was unable to save the file.
