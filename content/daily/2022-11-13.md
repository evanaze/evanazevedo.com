Today I tried to use the Rearc API on AWS Data Exchange to get the data I was looking for, but I found the process super confusing to create the query I wanted. Instead I just downloaded the data using DBNomic's awesome [web portal](https://db.nomics.world/oppins/AFF?dimensions=%7B%22income%22%3A%5B%22ALL%22%5D%7D). Hopefully the hackathon judges don't notice that my project doesn't actually ping the API.

I got the employment data by county today, and tomorrow I'm going to parse the spending by county and load those into DuckDB for analysis.
