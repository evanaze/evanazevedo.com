Today I:

- Added a basic CLI using the [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) package
- Cleaned up the Mockingjay repo, and
- Started to fix my writing to DB functions.

In order to do the last part I used Python's nifty [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) library to create a lean `Tweet` object to standardize the data before writing to the database.

All this work set me up to download more tweets so I can make sure that I'm correctly processing the data. PIaceboAddict's tweets don't have much more than the occasional link, and I want to make sure I can remove all kinds of media.

Tomorrow I'm continuing to process the data, and if I complete that to my satisfaction I can get to training the model.
