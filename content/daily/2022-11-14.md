Today I parsed the employment and spending data as I described [yesterday](../2022-11-13.md), and I made the tiling class object oriented and improved the logging. I also made the tiling program work in a step-by-step way, rather than needing to tile all of the files at once. This way if the program stops it can pick up from an intermediate state.
