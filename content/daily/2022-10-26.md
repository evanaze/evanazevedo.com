Today I started work on the hackathon project. My first metric I want to build is an overlay of housing affordability and
children's economic mobility. I'm going to use Zillow's [ZHVI](https://www.zillow.com/research/zhvi-user-guide/) to get the
housing cost and [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) for the economic mobility data.

Finally, I need income data which I can grab from [census.gov](https://census.gov/) in order to calculate some kind of housing
affordability metric similar to the [National Association of Realtors'](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/housing-affordability-index/methodology)
metric.
