I forgot to post my daily logs for a couple days, so here are the updates.

- I learned about [Bubble.io](https://bubble.io/), which I am going to use to build the prototype of the service for Decode.
- I listened to a great episode of the Startups for the Rest of Us podcast episode [559](https://startups-for-the-rest-of-us.castos.com/episodes/episode-559-bootstrapping-a-two-sided-marketplace-with-microaquire) about starting a two-sided marketplace, which is what Decode is going to be. Sounds like I will have to hustle a lot to get the buy-side and sell-side of the market place going. However, I imagine there will be a lot of exciting activity and cool features to build once we get the ball rolling.
- Fixed the daily section of my personal blog - which you are reading now! All that's left is to fix some minor CSS issues.

Goals coming up:

- Get a quick logo design so I can launch the website.
- Build the Github app (MVP).

Once I have that all set then I can work on making the smart contract.
