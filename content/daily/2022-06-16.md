Today I found some great content creators in the data science entrepreneurship, including [@v_vashishta](https://twitter.com/v_vashishta) who has his own AI strategy business, [@tomcritchlow](https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow) who is an indie marketing consultant and writes about being a consultant, [@marktenenholtz](https://twitter.com/marktenenholtz) who posts regularly about democratizing the skills of machine learning, and [@0xbnomial](https://twitter.com/0xbnomial), which posts a single ML question every day.

I also read a bit of [The Embedded Entrepreneur](https://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Entrepreneur-Build-Audience-Driven-Business/dp/3982195764), and [The Business of Expertise](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Expertise-Entrepreneurial-Experts-Convert/dp/1605440604).

I think it would be best for me to take better notes while I go through all of this material and set aside time to write about it using Andy Matuschak's method of [Evergreen note writing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be). This would allow me to think more clearly through the deluge of information I digest while I take it in.

Finally, I did some work on my machine learning side project. Again, I'm still working on the data collection phase. I'm using a SQLite database to store the data. I finally learned that the tweet response from the API includes all of the data I need, including when it was published and the `user_id`. Hopefully tomorrow I can get the dataset downloaded so I can focus on training the model.
