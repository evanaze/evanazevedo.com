## Hi! My name is Evan ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my website. I created this site to get in the habit of sharing what I'm learning and working on with others so I can be engaged in a like-minded community.

I grew up and currently live in the Bay Area, California.

### My interests

I play guitar in my spare time and have played since 2009. My favorite instrument is electric, and I love to play hard rock, thrash metal, blues, prog metal, and jazz.

I also practice Muay Thai and have been training since April 2021.

I'm a lover of books and podcasts. Someday I'd love to write about my thoughts on this blog, but I'm focusing my energy on a career change and may revisit that in the future. You can find my book list on my Goodreads [profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108059724-evan).

Here are some of my contrarian opinions. These are **NOT** my main talking points on the day-to-day, but they may interest you in terms of what I'm thinking currently. I try to be open-minded on these issues, which are subject to change.

- The United States should have [open borders](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42867903-open-borders?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=L7BRNtE8qQ&rank=1).
- Zoning should be [abolished](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59613917-arbitrary-lines?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=C7iYYNdvxH&rank=1).
- Children should learn probability and [decision making](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51066664-how-to-decide?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=jtZ2VbBQW2&rank=1) before trigonometry.

If you would like to connect with me, please feel free to shoot me an email or reach out on social. I enjoy meeting new people and would love to hear from you.

## My CV

Here's the boring part, but it describes how I got to where I am now.

### 2022: Software Engineer at a mid-sized startup

I'm a Software Engineer at a mid-sized startup focusing on test automation. My main tools are Python, Docker, TeamCity, and some bash.

### 2021 - 2022: Big data developer at a small consulting company

I was a software developer focusing on big data/analytics at a small consulting company based in Boston.

### 2020 - 2021: Odd jobs in tech

I took every job I could to get work experience during this period.

- I was a developer advocate at a blockchain company, [Amberdata](https://www.amberdata.io/), where I wrote technical marketing content to grow their online presence.
- I was a data science intern at [Aktana](https://www.aktana.com/), where I did a project quantifying their product suite's value to customers.
- I volunteered as a data science resource at Solos Health Analytics, a tiny startup trying to build a wearable to do early detection of Covid-19.
- I wrote technical marketing content and helped create demos for the solution architect at a small AI startup called Ople.

### 2019 - 2020: Searching for work

After graduation, I moved back to the bay area and spent a year trying to break into the data science field. Ultimately I could not find the job I was looking for and had to get more creative about how I would enter tech.

There are so many things I would tell myself then that would've helped me on my journey, so if anyone is in the same place I was, I hope you will find some ideas to help you.

Looking back, I think the biggest thing that held me back was not having a growth mindset. Now I'm much more comfortable seeking better habits, new information, conflicting points of view, and striving for a higher mode of being. In college, I fell into an acceptance of the status quo, and I think developing a growth mindset - while painful - has been one of the best things to have happened to me.

### 2014 - 2019: BS in physics and statistics at UC Santa Barbara

I did my undergrad at UC Santa Barbara in Physics and Statistical Science with an emphasis in Probability and Statistics.
