This is my first week back from diving into my hair-brained [startup idea](why-i-quit-saas-idea/index.md). Now I'm focused on getting a data science/machine learning job.

This week's progress has been starting my first machine learning project and learning about the state of the data science/ML job market by reading some great books.

Here are my updates in more depth.

## Project

I [started](daily/2022-06-13) my first machine learning project, tentatively called [PlaceBot](https://github.com/evanaze/placebot). This is a fun project that aims to allow users to imitate the tweets of a specific user.

I'm still at the beginning stage, where I want to download a user's tweets and store them locally in a SQLite3 database. 

Using a SQL database is a good practice and will help me remember my SQL/DB management skills.

I got stuck for a few days over-engineering the solution, but I am back on track and trying to get this out the door without too much overhead.

## Data science job market

Here are the resources I found that helped put the job market into perspective for me:

- [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://www.acethedatascienceinterview.com/) by Kevin Huo & Nick Singh. I wish I had this book as I wrapped up my undergrad three years ago.
- [Build a Career in Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Career-Science-Jacqueline-Nolis/dp/1617296244) by Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis. A very accessible and encouraging overview of the data science career journey.

I'm beginning to understand that to be successful, you need to:

- Understand the business problem
- Communicate the value of the project
- Ship (put the models into production)

Furthermore, I discovered [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969) by the fantastic Chip Huyen. This book focuses on shipping models to production and also addresses the common business problems and pitfalls associated with machine learning.

I am excited by the field of machine learning engineering and would like to start there if possible.

Finally, I started to learn about independent consulting. It seems like a promising path after I build up my machine learning skillset.

Consulting join strategy and execution to help companies improve along the dimension you are consulting them on.

## My career goals

At this stage of my career I value career capital and knowledge more than income. Here's how I rank my priorities in my next role from most to least important:

1. Creating value for others
2. Working on something that makes the world better, not worse
3. Learning my desired skill-set. Right now this is shipping machine learning models and/or helping make decisions that drive business impact.
4. Independence. I want to do work as an independent consultant/freelancer and move towards being an entrepreneur.
5. Making a lot of money

I hope understanding my career journey goals up front will increase my chances of success and reduce my search time. Thanks for tuning in and until next week!
