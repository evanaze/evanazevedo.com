I have a bit of a bone to pick with the FIRE movement. The FIRE movement falls for the same trap as the traditional retirement myth, and misses the bigger picture about what actually makes people fulfilled in life. But to use the Bruce Lee quote: "Eat the fish, spit out the bone." I will share the best lessons to take away from the FIRE movement and what we should be ignoring as fast as possible.

- Mr. Money Mustache, one of the figureheads of the FIRE community, has said several times something that stood out to me: "Most people who reach FIRE don't end up touching their retirement stash. They make money from doing things they enjoy, and because they cut down on their lifestyle, it's enough to fund it."
- I got into the FIRE movement because I had a really challenging time finding my first job out of college. I hated it so much that I vowed never to be in the same position again where I had to rely on job recruiters and hiring managers for my own happiness. The FIRE movement was appealing because it offered a way to get that power by being financially independent. However, my real issues were: 
	- I didn't work at all, so I felt useless, which tanked my self-confidence
	- I was going for an extremely competitive field because I thought I would enjoy it and it was high status, but nothing was preventing me from doing the field (data science) on my own. If I had, then I'd have example work or projects to share with others and I would've had a much easier time finding a job. I never really validated whether that was what I wanted to do.
- Who listened to this podcast with Mindy Jensen and Ramit Sethi and thought, "Man, I really hope I'm Mindy in a couple of years!"
- An implicit message of the FIRE movement is that "money will make me happy," as in "once I have this amount of money, then I can do what is fulfilling in life." In reality, for many people, finding fulfilling ways to contribute to others takes an incredibly long time and requires a lot of introspection. When we focus on hitting our FIRE number, we miss the forest for the trees. We all want to feel like we're contributing and helping others. We all have a drive for achievement. The FIRE movement tells us that we need to save up enough money that we'd never have to work again to start trying to answer the question about how we'd like to fulfill that need for ourselves.
- The best takeaways from the FIRE movement:
	- Live within your means and save & invest your excess income.
	- Avoid spending money on things that don't improve your life in some way and be a value shopper.
	- Find ways to make more money, such as job hopping, negotiating a better salary, or starting a side business.
	- One of the BEST ways we can spend our money is on doing less of what we don't like. For most people in the FIRE community, this is quitting their day job, but we should look to implement this on a smaller scale. Take a job that pays less but has better coworkers or a cooler project. Work seasonally and take time off to spend with your friends and family and invest in your hobbies. Just please, PLEASE, don't wait until you're fully financially independent to do it.
- Worst takeaways from the FIRE movement:
	- In order to do meaningful things, you need enough runway invested to last for the rest of your life.
	- Once you retire, you'll be so much happier than when you had a job because you'll have so much freedom.
	- Getting the money is the hard part. Once you have the money, THEN you can figure out what you want to do with your time.
	- You gain the bad habit of spending much less than you make. This tends to make you overly cheap and not prioritize your own happiness
- I don't mean to belittle situations where FIRE is an inevitability 
	- You get injured or have mental health issues and are unable to work anymore
	- You got a bad diagnosis and want to live the rest of your life without work
	- You have to step back from work to take care of a loved one
- How I look at it:
	- Learn about personal finance: investing in index funds, budgeting, and basic concepts about investing like cash flow, expenses, assets, etc. 
	- As you make money, live well below your means (without sacrificing too much) and invest the difference. As you move towards FI, start to consider money less and less when it comes to what you will do with your life. Take on contract work, or step down in responsibility, or make a career change to a less lucrative field.
	- Always think about your dream lifestyle, and continue to make steps in that direction. The goal is that you reach a terminal state where you can't imagine being happier with your day-to-day, and it brings you a ton of energy and that you get here far, FAR before you reach FI. To me, that is a huge success.
