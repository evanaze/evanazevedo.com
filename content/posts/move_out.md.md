Things that stood in my way:
- Unrealistic career expectations
- Social anxiety
- Addictions to: alcohol, nicotine, porn, social media
- Negative attitudes towards women
- Irregular exercise

Things I fixed that allowed me to have a life:
- Unrealistic career expectations

The important lesson here is that you don't need to have everything in line to get started. In fact, it's really important to do the opposite.

## How do I know which one to pick?
If one of the goals looks like it makes the others easier to achieve, then try to attack that one first. In my case, moving out of my parent's house made the following easier to address:
- Social anxiety, because I had higher self-confidence when I was more self-sufficient and enjoyed my life more.
- All of my addictions, because I was no longer in the same physical space so I could start to change my habits.

In reality I was working on all of them concurrently. Towards the end of it I had a therapist who was helping me with consuming less alcohol, I was going to the gym semi-regularly, and I was consuming self-help content to identify and address my other issues.

To fix that, I realized that I had to be able to visualize my goal and all of the steps it would take to get there. Otherwise, the plan was unrealistic.

How to do this:
1. Make a list of appealing goals
2. For each goal, if you think "oh yeah, that would be easy," then keep it. Otherwise, cross it out.
3. Pick only one goal.
4. Create a [[Kick-off document|kick-off document]] and get started.
