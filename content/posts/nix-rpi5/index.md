# Requirements

These are the requirements to follow this guide.
I will only be covering how to install NixOS onto a Micro SD card using a Mac, but if you're handy you may be able to figure out how to install the OS onto a flash drive or NVMe stick.

- Raspberry Pi 5 (duh)
- A monitor with an HDMI port and a Mini HDMI to HDMI cable for connecting the RPi to your monitor. Here's a link to one: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/standard-hdmi-a-male-to-mini-hdmi-c-male-cable/
- A USB keyboard for typing on the terminal of the RPi.
- A USB stick for booting the OS. Note that the entire flash drive will be dedicated to NixOS booting, so either use a small 8-16 GB drive that you have lying around or back up a larger one before wiping it and installing the OS.
- A micro SD card which will be the RPi's main source of storage.

Additionally, I used a Mac laptop to partition the boot drive and SD card, but you should be equally capable to do so with a Linux or Windows machine using their disk partitioning tools.

# Setup

We need to get the flash drive and SD card ready for the install.

The SD card is the trickier of the two.
The whole drive needs to be Fat32, and we need the drive to have two paritions: a small partition for containing the custom firmware needed to run UEFI on the RPi 5, and the rest of the drive dedicated to the OS.

This was a challenge because MacOS makes it very confusing on how to make multiple partitions on an MBR partitioned drive ðŸ™ƒ.
This is what worked for me.

## 1. Erase the SD card

First, erase the SD card and format it as Fat32 MBR.

## 2. Partition the SD card

Open the termin and find the name of your SD card with the command `diskutil list`.

{{<figure src="list_drives.png" alt="Finding the name of your SD card">}}

Mine was `/dev/disk2`
For a Linux machine you should be able to use the command `lsblk`.

Then I had to use the following command to partition the drive correctly.
Make sure to use the device name of your SD card from `diskutil list` after `diskutil partitionDisk` in this command:

```bash
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 MBR fat32 FIRST 100m fat32 SECOND 100m
```

Somehow this command gives us the partitions we want.
I thought it would size the partition named `SECOND` to `100m`, but it made it exactly the size we wanted.

Through this process I learned to not ask too many questions.

## 3. Load the Firmware

Now you should see two volumes mounted to your computer: `FIRST` and `SECOND`.
We're going to load the custom firmware to the drive named `FIRST`.

Download the firmware from this URL: https://github.com/worproject/rpi5-uefi.
You'll navigate to "Releases" in the bottom right corner:

{{<figure src="github_firmware.png" alt="The Releases section in GitHub">}}

And download the file named `RPi5_UEFI_Release_vX.Y.zip`.

Unzip the file, and copy all of the files within the unzipped folder to the volume named `FIRST`.

Eject the SD card and now we can move on to the boot drive.

## 4. Setup the Boot Drive

First, we need to wipe the boot drive and format to FAT32 and MBR like we did earlier with the SD card.
Download the 64-bit ARM version of the Minimal ISO image from the NixOS website: https://nixos.org/download/#nixos-iso.
This is the image we will flash to our boot drive.

BalenaEtcher is a free tool for doing just that, and is supported on a lot of OS'es: https://etcher.balena.io/
After that is installed, lanch balenaEtcher and select the ISO we just download.
You'll see this error about a missing partition table, but you can ignore that.
We'll be setting up our own ðŸ˜ˆ.

{{<figure src="balenaetcher.png" alt="An ignorable warning from balenaEtcher">}}

Continue by selecting your boot drive and flashing the ISO to the drive.
Sometimes an error will pop up, and I've found you might have to try flashing the drive a couple of times to get through the errors.
With that done, eject the boot drive and we can turn our attention to the Raspberry Pi.

# Installation

Now that your drives are properly formatted, let's get on with the actual install.
Plug in your SD card, USB drive, HDMI cable, and then the power source.
You should be greeted by this screen with the Raspberry Pi logo and a loading bar:

{{<figure src="rpi_loader.png" alt="The RPi Loading screen, showing a successful boot">}}

Following that you'll see the NixOS boot screen.
Either select the first option or wait a couple seconds and that'll be done for you.

From here on out, you'll be able to follow this guide with some slight modifications to install NixOS: https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation-manual.
