If you're like me, you bought the new, shiny Raspberry Pi 5 and assumed you could boot NixOS on it, only to find out that the device is not yet supported.
Dry those tears, because this guide is the exact steps I took to load NixOS onto my Raspberry Pi 5.

# Requirements

I will only be covering how to install NixOS onto a Micro SD card using a Mac, but if you're handy you may be able to figure out how to install the OS onto a flash drive or NVMe stick.

- Raspberry Pi 5 (duh)
- A monitor with an HDMI port and a Mini HDMI to HDMI cable for connecting the RPi to your monitor. Here's a link to one: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/standard-hdmi-a-male-to-mini-hdmi-c-male-cable/
- A USB keyboard for typing on the terminal of the RPi.
- A USB stick for booting the OS. Note that the entire flash drive will be dedicated to NixOS booting, so either use a small 8-16 GB drive that you have lying around or back up a larger one before wiping it and installing the OS.
- A micro SD card which will be the RPi's main source of storage.

Additionally, I used a Mac laptop to partition the boot drive and SD card, but you should be equally capable to do so with a Linux or Windows machine using their disk partitioning tools.

# Setup

We need to get the flash drive and SD card ready for the install.

The SD card is the trickier of the two.
The whole drive needs to be Fat32, and we need the drive to have two paritions: a small partition for containing the custom firmware needed to run UEFI on the RPi 5, and the rest of the drive dedicated to the OS.

This was a challenge because MacOS makes it very confusing on how to make multiple partitions on an MBR partitioned drive üôÉ.
This is what worked for me.

## 1. Erase the SD card

First, erase the SD card and format it as Fat32 MBR.

{{<figure src="erase_sd.png" alt="Erasing the SD card with Disk Utility">}}

## 2. Partition the SD card

Open the termin and find the name of your SD card with the command `diskutil list`.

{{<figure src="list_drives.png" alt="Finding the name of your SD card">}}

Mine was `/dev/disk2`
For a Linux machine you should be able to use the command `lsblk`.

Then I had to use the following command to partition the drive correctly.
Make sure to use the device name of your SD card from `diskutil list` after `diskutil partitionDisk` in this command:

```bash
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 MBR fat32 FIRST 100m fat32 SECOND 100m
```

Somehow this command gives us the partitions we want.
I thought it would size the partition named `SECOND` to `100m`, but it made it exactly the size we wanted.

Through this process I learned to not ask too many questions.

## 3. Load the Firmware

Now you should see two volumes mounted to your computer: `FIRST` and `SECOND`.
We're going to load the custom firmware to the drive named `FIRST`.

Download the firmware from this URL: https://github.com/worproject/rpi5-uefi.
You'll navigate to "Releases" in the bottom right corner:

{{<figure src="github_firmware.png" alt="The Releases section in GitHub">}}

And download the file named `RPi5_UEFI_Release_vX.Y.zip`.

Unzip the file, and copy all of the files within the unzipped folder to the volume named `FIRST`.

Eject the SD card and now we can move on to the boot drive.

## 4. Setup the Boot Drive

First, we need to wipe the boot drive and format to FAT32 and MBR like we did earlier with the SD card.
Download the 64-bit ARM version of the Minimal ISO image from the NixOS website: https://nixos.org/download/#nixos-iso.
This is the image we will flash to our boot drive.

BalenaEtcher is a free tool for doing just that, and is supported on a lot of OS'es: https://etcher.balena.io/
After that is installed, lanch balenaEtcher and select the ISO we just download.
You'll see this error about a missing partition table, but you can ignore that.
We'll be setting up our own üòà.

{{<figure src="balenaetcher.png" alt="An ignorable warning from balenaEtcher">}}

Continue by selecting your boot drive and flashing the ISO to the drive.
Sometimes an error will pop up, and I've found you might have to try flashing the drive a couple of times to get through the errors.
With that done, eject the boot drive and we can turn our attention to the Raspberry Pi.

# Installation

Now that your drives are properly formatted, let's get on with the actual install.
Plug in your SD card, USB drive, HDMI cable, and then the power source.
You should be greeted by this screen with the Raspberry Pi logo and a loading bar:

{{<figure src="rpi_loader.png" alt="The RPi Loading screen, showing a successful boot">}}

Following that you'll see the NixOS boot screen.
Either select the first option or wait a couple seconds and that'll be done for you.

{{<figure src="nixos_boot.png" alt="The NixOS booting screen">}}

From here on out, you'll be able to follow this guide with some slight modifications to install NixOS: https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation-manual.
Here are the steps:

1. Set yourself as the root user with `sudo -i`
2. Set up the WiFi with the commands from the section titled "Networking in the installer". **Note**: The custom firmware we loaded does not support Ethernet, so we have to use WiFi, just until we can fully install NixOS onto the SD card.
3. Unless you love typing on this bare terminal, you may want to use this opportunity to SSH into the Raspberry Pi from your computer. You don't need a keyboard connected to the RPi for the rest of this guide and can do the rest from SSH. If you don't want to se up SSH, skip to step 6. Set up a password for your root user with the command `passwd`, and your user account with `passwd username`.
4. Find the device's IP address with `ip addr`. Your IP address is under the section inet for wlan0 and is of the format W.X.Y.Z and probably starts with `192.168`.
5. SSH into the RPi from your computer with the command `ssh root@ip`, and enter your root password from step 3.
6. Find the SD card name with `lsblk`. It will probably start with `mmcblk`. For me it was `mmcblk0`
7. We'll follow the UEFI (GPT) section of the Partition and Formatting part of the NixOS guide. Partition the SD card with the following commands:

```bash
parted /dev/mmcblk0 -- mklabel gpt
parted /dev/mmcblk0 -- mkpart root ext4 512MB -8GB
parted /dev/mmcblk0 -- mkpart swap linux-swap -8GB 100%
parted /dev/mmcblk0 -- mkpart ESP fat32 1MB 512MB
parted /dev/mmcblk0 -- set 3 esp on
```

The first command will prompt you to wipe the disk.
This is because we're changing the partition scheme from MBR to GPT.
Wiping the disk like this will remove our firmware, but we will manually copy it back in a later step.
Otherwise, the RPi will not boot into NixOS.

8. Following the Formatting section of the NixOS guide, format the SD card with the following commands:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/mmcblk0p1
mkswap -L swap /dev/mmcblk0p2
mkfs.fat -F 32 -n boot /dev/mmcblk0p3
```

9. Now to the exciting part - installing the OS. I couldn't get the `by-label` stuff to work, so here's how I did it:

```bash
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/boot
mount -o umask=077 /dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt/boot
swapon /dev/mmcblk0p2
nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
```

10. Before we run `nixos-install` and get this party started for real, let's make some edits to the generated config. My preferred editor is Vim. NixOS comes with Nano pre-installed. I installed Vim with this command: `nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA vim`

11. These are the edits I made to the config with the command `vim mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```nix
# I don't know if this matters, but according to one of the guides I saw this should be in here
boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = false;

# Install vim for real, along with git
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  git
  vim
]
```

12. Finally, install NixOS with `nixos-install`

13. Before we reboot, don't forget to copy over the firmware to the SD card. This was the command I used to do that from my Mac:

```bash
# Navigate to directory with bootloader
cd $HOME/Downloads/RPi5_UEFI_Release_v0.3
scp -r . root@192.168.50.150:/mnt/boot
```

14. Type `reboot` and hit enter.

15. There's one last step before we can enjoy the RPi, and it's taken from https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_on_ARM/Raspberry_Pi_5:

> For the vendor kernel to boot properly, you must switch from ACPI to Device Tree in the UEFI settings (at Device Manager -> Raspberry Pi Configuration -> ACPI / Device Tree -> System Table Mode).

Now you should be all set to configure your Raspberry Pi to your heart's content.
