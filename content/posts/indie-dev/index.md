The dream I'm pursuing is: flexible, well paid work where I have optionality on who I work with and what projects I work on.
I'm a recently part-time software engineer with about 3 years of experience, so naturally I'm looking to become a freelance software developer.

## Difficulties of going solo

Here's what makes me nervous about the jump:

- The job market for software engineers isn't great.
- AI tools are quickly changing what it means to be a software engineer.
- I'm a beginner in web development, and most of the work I see for freelancers is for this kind of work.
- I've found reliable sources that indicate that this is a flawed business model. (#TODO link)
- But, most importantly, I haven't validated that I can get clients and make a living as a freelancer/solo agency.

Despite those fears, I'm taking the leap because even if I fail, I'll:

- Learn skills in sales and marketing, and I'll have built up my personal brand and portfolio.
- Gain feedback on what I enjoy working on.
- Network with people in my community and get a better idea of what businesses are out there.

Finally, I have a full year of expenses saved up and enough money invested in low-cost index funds that I should be able to enjoy a traditional retirement, even if I no longer contribute towards it.
This is the concept of Coast FI (#TODO link), and I think it's a great inflection point for someone who is a little on the risk-adverse side to consider trying a lifestyle different from the traditional 9-5.

## Work I would do gleefully

This whole thing is an experiment to test out a hypothesis: can I find work that is good as an end in itself?
Meaning, can work be a part of making you the best version of yourself?

### Arguments for work

Here are some arguments I can think of for work adding to your life.

#### 1. The Power of Habit

On one hand, studies show people who work live longer and face less mental decline than those that don't. (#TODO citation)
I think this is a result of the power of habit.
If I removed work from my life today and didn't replace it with something healthy, I would fill it with things that would bring me down like drinking, video games, and watching too much YouTube.

#### 2. Craft

Cal Newport is a popular influencer in the productivity space.
I definitely don't agree with everything he says, but I do subscribe to the idea that an important part of a good life is what he refers to has a craft.
This craft has the following attributes:

- It requires deep focus and dedication. From my research, periods of deep focus help us feel mindful, and fulfilled.
- You feel a sense of progression as you improve.
- Bonus points if it includes being outdoors, working with your hands, and/or being a part of a community of peers.

There's nothing that says you can't monitize your craft, and I can think of many that do.
Of course that comes with other downsides: if you rely on that money, you'll almost certainly be forced to choose between doing what works and what you enjoy.

### Arguments against work

Here's how I think work may oppose a life well lived.

#### 1. The value of leisure

On the other hand, I think the Protestant work ethic - the belief that all work is good and serves God - is rather convenient for the ruling class who wouldn't be caught dead doing any kind of labor. (#TODO link to In Praise of Leisure)
The article In Praise of Leisure by Bertrand Russell is one I always come back to.
Even middle managers are usually content sitting in meetings and organizing the work that needs to be done, rather than doing it themselves.

Nobility in ancient Rome found work to be distasteful (#TODO citation).
I believe people who do the jobs tha tmake the world work like agriculture, health care, teaching, transportation and infrastructure, etc. are grossly undervalued in American society and should be proud to do the work they do.
They deserve higher pay and to afford frequent leisure.

#### 2. Stress

While there are studies that show positive health outcomes from work, there are also studies that show the opposite.
We've all felt an unhealthy level of stress from work, especially when work spills over into your personal life, causing stress when you can't be present outside of work.
In my experience and the experience of others I've found, this becomes is more common the more money you make.

## Why I'm not considering traditional FIRE

I love the FIRE - meaning Financial Independence, Retire Early - community.
Pretty much everything I have learned about personal finance and lifestyle design have stemmed from an interest in the FIRE movement in my early 20's.
One might think FIRE gives the best of both worlds: you have the freedom to work on what matters to you or not.
Your time is wholly your own.

That said, pursuing full FIRE isn't very appealing to me at this point.
In order to make that work, I'd have to grind out the next 10 years or so, making as much money as I can and stashing away huge portions of it.
I probably wouldn't enjoy the ride very much given my goal of making as much as possible.
At the end of it all I'd have a decently sized pile of money to afford a happy lifestyle, but then I'd have to unlearn my bad habits from grinding towards my freedom and design an entirely new life for myself.

Furthermore, it's very capital inefficient, especially in the time frame I'd be looking to do it (about 10 years or less).
Meaning, the bulk of money in my retirement portfolio would have been contributed by my earned income, rather than investment income or capital gains.

Finally, I would like to have a family someday, and potentially a larger-than-average family of 3 children.
I consider myself moderately frugal, but I still see that as a large and unknown financial burden, so it would be hard to know what my true FIRE number is before I've made my way through a lot of parenthood.

I'm nervous because I'm reducing my full-time hours to part-time so I can take a stab a building a freelance software development business.
I've reached this decision as a result of a financial milestone I've hit, and I want to share my story as inspiration to those who may be considering a similar move.
I'd like to position this post as sort of lifestyle design.
Without going too deep on what lifestyle design is, suffice to say - when something isn't working, you have to try out something else you think you might like better.

I'm a minimalist and a maximizer.
They sound at odds, but they really go hand-in-hand.
I love to think about how I can get the most out of everything I have as a joy in and of itself.
While being early in my career as a software engineer, I think I have a decent idea of the maximum fulfillment I can get from full-time employment.
It's not bad.
At a great company, I think there would probably be a lot of upsides that I would enjoy.

On the other hand, I'm lazy. I did a short 1 year stint being "overemployed" and working two jobs. It was lucrative for me, but at this season of my life, I don't want to go back to that. Some people are good about doing their job and applying to other jobs or upskilling outside of work so they can eventually get to that great job, but I have yet to prove to myself that I have the discipline to make that work. I'd like to see if having more space in my life by going down to part-time work will allow me the energy and time to do that important work.

Furthermore, I think even in the most ideal scenario, my maximum fulfillment would be a seven or possibly eight out of ten. Those numbers are fantastic, and I am absolutely blessed to be able to pursue that, but I wonder if I can do better. Unfortunately, being an employee pretty much always means attending meetings you don't want to attend, and kissing up to people who you'd rather not.

I have two more constraints I'm working within that are encouraging me to give Coast FI a try:

If I go freelance/independent with software development, I can dedicate 50% or more of my time to marketing and refining my services, which in theory would help me get more fulfilling work more quickly than spending 80-100% of my time on delivering my services like I do now.

What I need to be careful of in this experiment is not doing the work I indend to after going part time. If I just become lazy and am doomscrolling YouTube and getting stoned instead of filling my time with fulfilling activities or progressing my business, I'll consider that a failure.
