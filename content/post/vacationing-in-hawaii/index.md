I have taken a break from writing my [daily](/daily) logs because I've been staying in Maui, Hawaii all week. I'm also staying for the next week but I'm working remotely from Maui so I'll be more active in posting updates.

Just because I've been on vacation, doesn't mean that I haven't been learning new things. I'll share some things I've learned this week, and wrap up with some updates about my trip.

## What I learned

I think taking time off is really important in terms of being able to do your best work. It allows space for reflection and recharging. 

### Networking

### Thinking in Bets

## Traveling in Hawaii

I was fortunate enough to stay at my partner's parent's house in Maui this week.
