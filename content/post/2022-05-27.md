I figured out some tactical things about building decode, and setup the website through Cloudflare.

Tactical considerations:

- I'm going to build a Github App for the integration with Github. This is as opposed to Github actions, which wouldn't have the functionality I'm looking for.
- I'm going to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the front-end because it looks like the best framework for just web apps. Of course React would be great as well, but I don't want to have to become a Javascript expert in order to build this, and it looks like Bootstrap has a lower learning curve. I also investigated Flutter, but it looks like that one is more mobile focused.
- I decided to go with Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), even though I bought the domain on AWS and have this website hosted on AWS Amplify.

Unfortunately, all the messing with Cloudflare ended up breaking my personal blog website. I'm working to get that back under control. In the meantime, I figure that Cloudflare is just adding another layer of complexity and I decided to just host the whole thing through AWS.
