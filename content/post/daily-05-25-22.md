Yesterday I forgot to make a log, but I secured a URL for my website: [decode.cash](http://decode.cash). I bought it with AWS and still need to get it routing through Cloudflare.

Today I worked on learning the basics of Django. At least that's what I'm telling myself. Really, I futzed with getting `tox` to run with `pyenv` so I could make a consistent testing and linting environment for my repo.

I discovered that I had a broken symlink at `usr/local/bin/tox` that was linking to a version of `python3.7` that I manually uninstalled long ago, leaving broken symlinks laying around. In the process I learned a lot about how `pyenv` works, reviewed the `$PATH` variable and how `zsh` initializes the shell, and even cleaned some packages out of homebrew that weren't being used.

I've decided the best next step is to start with the core functionality of the app:

- Signing in to Github.
- Signing in to Metamask.
- Linking an issue in Github to a bounty in the app.
- Creating a smart contract that completes the transaction.
- Creating a Github automation that inserts the link to the bounty to the Issue.

I have a basic sequence diagram for how the app will work that I will share at one point after I code it up in [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/sequenceDiagram).
