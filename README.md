My portfolio site built with:

- [hugo](https://gohugo.io) for rendering the site and allowing me to write blog content in comfortable markdown
- [Franken-UI](https://franken-ui.dev) for styling
- [Devenv](https://devenv.sh/) for building the site with Nix


# Local Dev
- Serve up the site with Hugo - `npm run serve`
- Watch for Tailwind changes and regenerate the `output.css` file - `npm run tw`
